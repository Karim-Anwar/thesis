abstract="It is widely accepted that the field of Data Analytics has entered into the era of Big Data. In particular, it has to deal with so-called Big Graph Data, which is the focus of this paper. Graph Data is present in many fields, such as Social Networks, Biological Networks, Computer Networks, and so on. It is recognized that data analysts benefit from interactive real time data exploration techniques such as clustering and zoom capabilities on the clusters. However, although clustering is one of the key aspects of graph data analysis, there is a lack of scalable graph clustering algorithms which would support interactive techniques. This paper presents an approach based on combining graph clustering and graph coordinate system embedding, and which shows promising results through initial experiments. Our approach also incorporates both structural and attribute information, which can lead to a more meaningful clustering.",

abstract = "From the perspective of machine learning and data mining applications, expressing data in RDF rather than a domain-specific for- mat can add complexity and obfuscate the internal structure. We in- vestigate and illustrate this issue with an example where bio-molecular graph datasets are expressed in RDF. We use this example to inspire pre- processing techniques which reverse some of the complications of adding semantic annotations, exposing those patterns in the data that are most relevant to machine learning. We test these methods in a number of clas- sification experiments and show that they can improve performance both for our example datasets and real-world RDF datasets.",

abstract={The explosion in the amount of the available RDF data has lead to the need to explore, query and understand such data sources. Due to the complex structure of RDF graphs and their heterogeneity, the exploration and understanding tasks are significantly harder than in relational databases, where the schema can serve as a first step toward understanding the structure. Summarization has been applied to RDF data to facilitate these tasks. Its purpose is to extract concise and meaningful information from RDF knowledge bases, representing their content as faithfully as possible. There is no single concept of RDF summary, and not a single but many approaches to build such summaries; each is better suited for some uses, and each presents specific challenges with respect to its construction. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive survey of summarization method for semantic RDF graphs. We propose a taxonomy of existing works in this area, including also some closely related works developed prior to the adoption of RDF in the data management community; we present the concepts at the core of each approach and outline their main technical aspects and implementation. We hope the survey will help readers understand this scientifically rich area and identify the most pertinent summarization method for a variety of usage scenarios.},
